# Zomato Data Analysis

This project explores restaurant trends and customer preferences using a dataset from Zomato. The goal is to analyze restaurant types, ratings, votes, and ordering behavior to gain insights into the dining scene. The analysis includes visualizing the distribution of restaurant categories, customer ratings, and the cost for two people. The project also compares the ratings of online vs offline orders and highlights the types of restaurants that are more popular for online orders.

## Key Features:
- **Data Cleaning**: Extracting and formatting restaurant ratings.
- **Restaurant Type Distribution**: Visualizing the most common types of restaurants listed.
- **Votes Analysis**: Summing up votes by restaurant type to assess popularity.
- **Rating Distribution**: Analyzing the spread of restaurant ratings.
- **Cost for Two Analysis**: Identifying the most common price range for dining out.
- **Online vs Offline Order Ratings**: Comparing the ratings for online vs offline orders.
- **Heatmap**: Visualizing the relationship between restaurant type and ordering method (online/offline).

## Technologies Used:
- **Python** for data manipulation and analysis
- **Pandas** for data cleaning and preparation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization
